# Four-Digit-Guessing-Game
Try to guess a 4-digit number that the program has randomly selected. 

This is a fun little program that allows you to guess a 4-digit number. It tells you when you are getting closer and if you guess correctly, you win. The 4 digits are randomly selected each time you run the program. Here is a sample run.

Hello! I am thinking of a passcode with four numbers.
\* = number is in correct location.
0 = number is in passcode but not in correct location.
